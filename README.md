# Global estimate of Riverine Methane Flux

This is an ongoing project trying to quantify CH4 emissions from rivers in space and time.

Code is in the code/ folder, and data is currently in a google drive. The script 1-3 is to download and process GIS data, takes long time and you can skip it. If you start on #4 it should download automatically the file with data and predictors for the modelling part.


More to come!
