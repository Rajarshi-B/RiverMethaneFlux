# Global estimate of Riverine Methane Flux

This is an ongoing project trying to quantify CH4 emissions from rivers in space and time.

Code is in the code/ folder, and data is currently in a google drive. The script `0_get_files.R` can be used to get the files in your local machine.

More to come!
